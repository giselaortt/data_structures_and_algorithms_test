data structures and algorithms with java.

Considerations about the problems:

1) binary tree

    - Ambiguity. I have not understood wether the description asks for it to generate as many pairs as needed until one is accepted as input, or to generate just one. "and it continues with another generation" could mean another eneration for the same iteration or to the next ? in other words, do i need to generate infitiy number of pairs until k are inserted or generate k no matter how many are inserted ?

2) hash table
    
    - Here there were 2 options, to go for a hashmap or use ArrayList to simulate a hashmap. Arraylist might be better depending on how maps are implemented on java.

3) greedy (very easy)


4) dynamic programming (problem of the backpack)



5) djikstra:

    - There are different ways to pass a function as a parameter. Lambda functions, callable. It is possible to change if explicitly stated that this is necessary.

    - the waiting function to be passed for djakstra method should be of the type double function( int i, double t )
