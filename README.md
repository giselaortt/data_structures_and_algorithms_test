data structures and algorithms with java.

Considerations about the problems:

1) binary tree

2) hash table

3) greedy (very easy)

4) dynamic programming (problem of the backpack)



5) djikstra:

    - There are different ways to pass a function as a parameter. Lambda functions, callable. It is possible to change if explicitly stated that this is necessary.

    - the waiting function to be passed for djakstra method should be of the type double function( int i, double t )
