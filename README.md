data structures and algorithms with java.

Considerations about the problems:

1) binary tree

    - Ambiguity. I have not understood wether the description asks for it to generate as many pairs as needed until one is accepted as input, or to generate just one. "and it continues with another generation" could mean another eneration for the same iteration or to the next ? in other words, do i need to generate infitiy number of pairs until k are inserted or generate k no matter how many are inserted ?

2) hash table
    

3) greedy (very easy)


4) dynamic programming (problem of the backpack)


5) djikstra
